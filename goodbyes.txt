It is so hard to leave, until you leave. And then it is the easiest thing in the world.
So long, and thanks for all the fish!
We are really going to miss trying to avoid you around here.
Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.
After all, tomorrow is another day.
In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.
